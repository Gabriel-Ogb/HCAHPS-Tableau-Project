Patient Experience and Improvement Priorities Across Denver Hospitals
Citywide Analysis of HCAHPS Survey Results — Denver, 2023

Executive Summary
This project analyzes 2023 HCAHPS survey data from five Denver hospitals to evaluate patient experience performance, identify key drivers of dissatisfaction, and prioritize high-impact improvement opportunities.
Moving beyond traditional Top-Box metrics, the analysis integrates response distribution patterns, Opportunity for Improvement (OFI), and volume-weighted impact proxies to reveal structural limitations of Top-Box scores and provide a more realistic basis for quality improvement prioritization.
An interactive Tableau dashboard enables multi-level exploration of patient experience at the citywide, hospital, measure, and question levels.

Healthcare Context
HCAHPS is a nationally standardized patient experience survey used by CMS for public reporting, value-based purchasing, and quality benchmarking. Hospitals rely on HCAHPS insights to guide patient-centered care initiatives and resource allocation. Conventional reliance on Top-Box scores however, often obscures dissatisfaction patterns and misrepresents performance, particularly for binary-response measures. This project addresses that analytical gap.

Objectives
•	Evaluate patient experience using Top-Box, Top + Middle-Box, and Bottom-Box distributions.
•	Identify underperforming measures and questions using dissatisfaction signals.
•	Quantify improvement opportunity using OFI and survey volume.
•	Develop an impact-oriented framework for prioritizing patient experience interventions.
•	Deliver an interactive analytics dashboard for decision support.

Data Overview
Source: Publicly reported CMS HCAHPS data (2023)
Scope: Five Denver hospitals
Key variables:
•	Hospital identifier
•	HCAHPS measures and questions
•	Survey and answer counts
•	Top-, Middle-, and Bottom-Box responses

Analytical Framework
Core Performance Metrics
•	Top-Box %
Proportion of respondents reporting the most positive experience.
•	Top + Middle-Box %
Indicator of overall reliability of care, beyond excellence alone.
•	Bottom-Box %
Concentration of dissatisfaction and unmet expectations.
Opportunity & Impact Metrics
•	Opportunity for Improvement (OFI)
Gap between observed performance and ideal performance.
•	Survey Volume Weight
Hospital contribution to citywide patient experience outcomes.
•	Estimated Improvement Impact (Proxy)
Volume-weighted OFI used to identify high-leverage improvement targets.
This framework shifts the analytical focus from performance ranking to improvement prioritization.

Dashboard Design
The Tableau dashboard integrates eight analytical views:
1.	Citywide Top-Box Performance by Measure
2.	Top-Box vs Top + Middle-Box Comparison
3.	Response Distribution Analysis
4.	Top- vs Bottom-Box Scatterplot
5.	OFI-Based Ranking of Measures
6.	Hospital Contribution Bubble Chart
7.	Question-Level Heat Map
8.	Estimated Improvement Impact Analysis
Interactive filters enable dynamic analysis across hospitals, measures, and questions.

Key Insights
1) Systemic Patterns in Patient Experience
Patient experience varies across measures, but performance patterns are highly consistent across hospitals. This suggests that measure-level dynamics—not hospital-specific factors—drive most observed variation.
2) Limitations of Top-Box Metrics
Binary-response measures achieve the highest Top-Box scores while also exhibiting elevated Bottom-Box rates. This demonstrates that Top-Box performance can be inflated by survey structure rather than superior care delivery.
3) Hidden Drivers of Dissatisfaction
“Communication about Medicines,” particularly discussions of side effects, shows the highest Bottom-Box rates, indicating a critical gap in patient-provider communication.
4) Reframing Excellence in Care
Measures such as nurse and doctor communication demonstrate stronger overall performance when evaluated using combined Top- and Bottom-Box signals, challenging rankings based solely on Top-Box scores.


5) Volume Matters
Hospitals with larger survey volumes exert disproportionate influence on citywide patient experience outcomes.
6) Impact-Based Prioritization
Volume-weighted impact analysis produces improvement priorities that differ materially from Top-Box rankings, highlighting the risk of misaligned quality improvement strategies.

Recommendations
Strategic Recommendations
•	Adopt multi-metric frameworks for patient experience evaluation rather than relying solely on Top-Box scores.
•	Prioritize improvement initiatives using impact-weighted metrics that reflect both performance gaps and patient volume.
•	Reassess performance benchmarking for binary-response HCAHPS measures.
Operational Recommendations
•	Strengthen medication communication protocols, particularly around side effects.
•	Standardize communication best practices across clinical teams.
•	Integrate Bottom-Box monitoring into routine quality dashboards.
Analytics Recommendations
•	Expand analysis to multi-year trends and case-mix adjustment.
•	Incorporate patient demographics and service-line segmentation.
•	Develop predictive models to identify drivers of dissatisfaction.

Tools & Technologies
•	Tableau (advanced calculations, parameters, interactive dashboards)
•	SQL & Excel (data preparation and validation)
•	GitHub (documentation and portfolio presentation)

Limitations
•	Analysis is based on aggregated survey data.
•	Impact metrics are proxies and do not imply causality.
•	Findings reflect a single year of data.

Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates how healthcare analytics can move beyond descriptive reporting to actionable intelligence. By integrating performance gaps with patient volume, it provides a practical framework for aligning patient experience insights with strategic quality improvement decisions.
